 WHO WE ARE

We are a community of researchers, engineers, scientists, designers, physic, makers, and more. The one thing we all have in common? We share an unfaltering passion for harnessing the Quantum Computing to further understand and expand who we are. As our community continues to grow, so does the range of possibilities of what we can discover and create together. What can we build together?

 WHAT WE DO

OpenQbit stands for the development of hardware and software easy use with tecnology quantum. We provide anyone the tools necessary to create devices that use tecnology quantum. We create the solid foundations to create solutions that use quantum technology and our goal is to create the first quantum computer that is accessible in price for any place in the world from a house to companies and corporations.

 WHY WE DO IT

Currently quantum computing has shown that it will be a great help in all sectors of the world population. However, this technology has very high costs, we speak that currently the quantum computers created exceed millions of dollars and that it is visualized that only economic powers could have it, we think that equal opportunity should be equitable for anyone regardless of economic level, or content , neither ethnic class, nor other differentiators that we currently have worldwide. We want a better world where cutting-edge technological solutions can be applied anywhere in the world. We create the first quantum computer where the economic cost can be covered by anyone.
